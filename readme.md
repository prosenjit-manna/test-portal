> **The Ultimate Comprehensive Template for Maximizing GitHub Copilot's Potential Across the Entire Software Development Lifecycle**

This repository serves as a **complete blueprint** for leveraging GitHub Copilot's AI capabilities across every phase of software development - from initial project conception to production deployment. Whether you're a startup building your MVP or an enterprise scaling your development process, this template provides proven patterns and best practices.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repository Matters

### For Developers
- **10x Productivity**: Learn to harness Copilot for rapid development without sacrificing quality
- **Best Practices**: Battle-tested patterns for AI-assisted coding across multiple tech stacks
- **Real-World Examples**: Production-ready code samples and implementations

### For Teams & Organizations
- **Standardized Workflows**: Consistent development patterns across your entire organization
- **Faster Onboarding**: New developers can be productive from day one
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing, documentation, and code review processes

### For Project Managers & Stakeholders
## Open Source Test Management (TestRail Alternative)

An open-source test management system for organizing test cases, planning runs, tracking execution, and ingesting automated results â€” designed to be Docker-first with a React + TypeScript frontend and a Node.js (NestJS) + Prisma + PostgreSQL backend.

Updated: 2025-08-10

â€¢ PRD: See prd/readme.md for detailed scope, requirements, data model, and roadmap.

## Why this project
- Full-featured, team-friendly alternative to proprietary test management tools
- Easy to run locally and in small cloud setups
- Extensible API for CI/CD and automation frameworks

## MVP feature set (highlights)
- Projects, suites, sections, cases (with steps, expected results, tags, priority, references)
- Manual test runs with per-case results, comments, and attachments
- Plans and milestones for release planning
- Batch API for automated results ingestion
- Dashboards and exports (CSV/JSON)
- Users, roles, permissions; audit log; API tokens; webhooks

## Architecture (high level)
- Frontend: React + TypeScript (SPA), consumes REST/JSON
- Backend: Node.js + NestJS, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL
- Packaging: Docker images for both services

## Repository structure (current and planned)
```
backend/        # Backend service (NestJS + Prisma) â€” scaffolding pending
frontend/       # React + TypeScript app â€” scaffolding pending
prd/            # Product Requirements Document (authoritative spec)
gantt-app/      # Existing Next.js sample app (not part of test mgmt product)
meeting-notes/  # Notes and documentation
mobile/         # Placeholder (not in MVP scope)
ui-protype/     # UI explorations / design system (optional)
```

Note: The test management app will live under backend/ and frontend/. The gantt-app is a separate example app kept in the monorepo and not part of this product.

## Getting started

Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop
- Node.js 18+ (for local dev workflows)

Quick start (coming soon)
- docker-compose.yml will define services: frontend, backend, postgres
- One command to start both services and a database

Local development (planned)
- Backend: NestJS app with Prisma; Postgres connection via .env
- Frontend: React + TS app configured to target the backend REST API

## API
- REST/JSON under /api/v1 (planned)
- OpenAPI spec will be published under docs/openapi once endpoints stabilize

## Roadmap (summary)
- MVP (0.1): Case management with steps; manual runs/results; dashboards; CSV export; JWT auth + RBAC; audit log; Docker Compose
- Beta (0.2â€“0.3): Automated results batch API; webhooks; plans/milestones; imports (CSV + basic TestRail mapping); saved filters/views
- v1.0: Hardened RBAC, pagination/search at scale, polished UX and accessibility, optional Redis + worker for async jobs

See prd/readme.md for the full roadmap and acceptance criteria.
